# Ethical Hacking Roadmap

Welcome to the ultimate guide for becoming an Ethical Hacker – all for free! Feel free to share this roadmap with your friends and fellow enthusiasts.

If you're a complete beginner and not sure where to start, don't worry. I've prepared a comprehensive roadmap for you, complete with learning resources and free courses. There are many paths to choose from, but this roadmap is specifically tailored for those aiming to become professional bug bounty hunters and penetration testers.

# Ethical Hacker Zero To Hero
This roadmap may not be suitable for everyone. It's designed primarily for those interested in network hacking and web application/API hacking. If you want to learn game hacking, mobile hacking, malware analysis, or other specializations, you'll need to pursue additional research in those areas.

This roadmap might appear overwhelming at first glance. Realistically, it will take 1-2 years to complete. Take your time and enjoy the learning journey rather than just focusing on the end goal.
### You Must Do these :
- Network with other Hackers / Cyber security Researchers via Twitter and LinkedIn.
- Watch Other Hackers Podcasts.You can learn lot's of things that you cannot learn in a paid course also.Still I Do these things.
- Be curious about new technologies,New Updates 
- Create accounts in tryhackme.com ,academy.hackthebox.com and portswigger.com
	*If you are comfortable with Tryhackme content.just continue that learning paths*

### My Personal Advice / Suggestions :
-  To become a great hacker, maintain that curious mindset that constantly questions how things work. Everyone has that inner curiosity—don't let it fade away.
- Some people say "You don't need programming for cybersecurity." I disagree. You need some programming languages to automate tasks and create tools tailored to your needs. Programming helped me accelerate my learning journey.
- Don't worry though, we'll learn programming when it becomes necessary. Until then, we won't focus on it.
- You don't need to spend thousands of dollars on paid courses. With some research, you can find many courses available completely free.
- Stay active on LinkedIn because many professionals share free courses, tips, and tricks there as well.
- Consistency is crucial, but that doesn't mean you need to learn hacking all day, every day.
- When you feel burned out, it's perfectly okay to take a break. Take a few days for fun activities, then get back to learning with renewed energy.

##### Follow this TryHackMe Learning Paths : 
there are some rooms that only for premium subscribers .just google search the lesson's title name and you can find some write ups of that. that's how I do those for free.
	If you can spend some bucks to tryhackme .It is absolutely worth for money.(by the way , I am not affiliated with any of those organizations .I learn by them ,I'm just suggesting for you)

### Don't Be like Spoon feeden
This field is vast and constantly updating. It's hard to provide a complete roadmap from start to finish. You'll need to learn things daily throughout your career.
- If you get stuck on a problem, try these steps:
	- Search on Google - this is your best friend
	- Use ChatGPT or similar AI tools
	- Search on YouTube for tutorials
	
Most of the time, a good Google search will give you the answer. Learning how to search effectively is a crucial skill in this field.

### Don't Skip The fundamentals :
- [Introductory Researching](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoresearch)
- Networking Basics
  - OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
  - IP Addressing and Subnetting
  - Common Network Protocols
  - Network Architecture
- Linux Basics
  - Command Line Navigation
  - File System Management
  - User and Permission Management
  - Process Management
  - Basic Shell Scripting

	- RESTful APIs
- [DBMS Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) (Database Management System) - { Optional }
	 *learn something like mySQL ,this will helpful when we learn about Database Injections Like SQL injection*

### Learn These simultaneously with fundamentals : 
I would say ,learn these things simultaneously while you learning fundamentals. If you want ,It is OK to learn after the fundamentals.

- Basics of cyber security
	- CIA triad
	- Types of malware
	- Types of Penetration testing
		- Black Box Penetration testing (no prior knowledge of target)
		- Gray Box Penetration testing (limited knowledge of target)
		- White Box Penetration testing (complete knowledge of target)
	- Penetration Testing Methodology
		- Planning and Reconnaissance
		- Scanning and Enumeration
		- Gaining Access
		- Maintaining Access
		- Covering Tracks
		- Analysis and Reporting

I suggest you to learn the Network hacking and Web Hacking Simultaneously.Because that is the easy way to start CTFs. It's all up to you.

### Your Roadmap Sucks.Gimme some paid Courses.
If you planned to Buy some courses.These are my suggestions.As usual I Don't get any single buck by recommending these.

- TCM Security 25+ hours Hacking Course.
- TCM Security Bug Bounty Course.
- TCM Security Linux Privilege Escalation Course .
- TCM Security Windows Privilege Escalation Course .

Now TCM Security offer a monthly subscription plan that can access all of the courses for 30$ /month.I am a huge fan of TCM-Security Courses because I learn By them so I Can't even think about a better place for paid or free courses.
