# Ethical Hacker Zero To Hero
This road-map does not suitable for all people.This Road map will suitable for People who want to start there journey with network Hacking and web Application / API Hacking. If you want to learn Game Hacking , Mobile Hacking , Malware Analysis ,etc . Please feel free to do some research.

Sometimes this roadmap looks so overwhelming .This roadmap will take up to 1-2 years. so take your time and enjoy the process.not the final destination.
### You Must Do these :
- Network with other Hackers / Cyber security Researchers via Twitter and LinkedIn.
- Watch Other Hackers Podcasts.You can learn lot's of things that you cannot learn in a paid course also.Still I Do these things.
- Be curious about new technologies,New Updates 
- Create accounts in tryhackme.com ,academy.hackthebox.com and portswigger.com
	*If you are comfortable with Tryhackme content.just continue that learning paths*

### My Personal Advice / Suggestions :
-  To become a Great Hacker.You want that curious Little baby that always have questions about all the things. Yes! Everyone has that baby.Don't let it killed.
- Some people say that "You don't need programming for Cyber Security" . I am in the opposite side.You need some kind of Programming Languages to Automate things and make new tools that suitable for the work.Actually Programming help me to speed up my learning journey.
- But Don't worry, we are going to learn Programming when that is needed.until that we don't.
- You don't need to spend thousands of $ for paid courses.do some research and you can find many courses that are available for completely free.
- Stay active in LinkedIn because some people share free courses and tips and tricks in LinkedIn as well.
- Constancy is needed .But it doesn't mean you want to Learn Hacking all day all time.
-  When you feel the burn out.It is OK to pause the learning.Just do some fun activities for couple of days and get back to work. 
##### Follow this TryHackMe Learning Paths :
